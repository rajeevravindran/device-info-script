I've assumed this script is being run a Raspberry Pi. The unique idenitifer is the Serial address of each Raspberry Pi. 
The output of the script is formatted as a JSON string, making it easy to be parsed by an server. 

The python simulation is menu driven. I've not added any exception handling as of now
